This project aims to predict the profit of startups based on their R&D Spend, Administration Spend, and Marketing Spend using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Regressor. The dataset consists of 50 samples, each representing a startup and its corresponding spending in different departments, along with the profit generated.
